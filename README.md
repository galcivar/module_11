# Module 11
### Instructions:

You’re a growth analyst at MercadoLibre (Links to an external site.). With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. You've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, you want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

In a bid to drive revenue, you’ll produce a Jupyter notebook that contains your data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. You’ll use text and comments to document your findings, and you’ll answer the question prompts in the instructions. Specifically, this file should contain the following:

- Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.

- An evaluation of how the company’s stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.

- A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.

- Answers to questions in the instructions that you write in your Jupyter Notebook.

- (Optional) A plot of a forecast for the company’s future revenue.
